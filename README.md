## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JQuery


### What I learned

I gained more experience in reading API documentation and coordinating two APIs in one project. 


### Continued development

I would now like to advance to learn more javascript frameworks and libraries before working on more projects. I would like to create larger projects using APIs in the future.
